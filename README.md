This repository contains a simplified version of the original implementation published at [https://github.com/bit-ml/Private-Set-Intersection/tree/main](https://github.com/bit-ml/Private-Set-Intersection/tree/main). In this version, you'll find an additional folder called `examples`, which includes various examples that demonstrate the final version of the protocol in an easy-to-understand way. The purpose of this repository is to provide a basic, academic-focused version of the original implementation.

## How to Run the Original Version

1. **Set Up the Environment**  
- Review the `requirements.txt` file for a list of necessary Python libraries.
- We recommend using Python version 3.12.1 and a Linux environment for best compatibility.
- For setup guidance, check out this [Codespace tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_01iCF9sO1c&ab_channel=GitHub).

2. **Run the Process**  
- **Step 1:** Run `python set_gen.py` to generate the server and client testing databases.
- **Step 2:** Execute `python server_offline.py` and `python client_offline.py` to preprocess the data as part of the offline phase.
- **Step 3:** In one terminal, start the server with `python server_online.py`. (This process will wait for the client to complete.)
- **Step 4:** In a separate terminal, run `python client_online.py` to complete the process.

## Run addicional examples
Within this folde you will find four examples for a better understanding of the PSI procotol proposed by [original repository](https://github.com/bit-ml/Private-Set-Intersection), a brief description of each document follows: 

**Note before to start:** to run the examples you need to access to the folder examples via terminal as follows: `cd examples`

Run the follow commands to:
- `python testing_basic_protocol` Emulate the most basic protocol interaction of [2017/299](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/299.pdf) divided into 4 steps (pre-processing, encryption, polynomial evaluation, decryption and interaction).
- `python testing_basic_protocol_oprf` Emulate the protocol interaction of [2018/787](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/787.pdf) (similar to testing_basic_protocol but including the oprf process).
- `python testing_optimized_protocol` Full protocol emulation step by step, where besides including the testing_basic_protocol_oprf steps, performance improvement techniques are exemplified such as: windowing, batching, hasing, etc.
- `python testing_particion` A simple example for a better understanding of the hasing process

## How It Works

This project is based on the [original repository](https://github.com/bit-ml/Private-Set-Intersection), which provides a Python implementation of the protocols discussed in two papers: [2017/299](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/299.pdf) and [2018/787](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/787.pdf).

The protocol uses homomorphic encryption, a cryptographic method that allows computations on encrypted data such that only the holder of the secret key can decrypt the result. Specifically, this project implements Private Set Intersection (PSI) using the FV homomorphic encryption scheme provided by the TenSEAL library. 

For further details, you may also refer to a recent SEAL-based C++ implementation of the protocol, published by Microsoft.

Additionally, a simplified explanation of the code and paper is available on the [Bit-ML GitHub blog](https://bit-ml.github.io/blog/post/private-set-intersection-an-implementation-in-python/).
